# laser-pointer-tracker
## WIP
Generic laser presentation pointers are inexpensive, and a cheap way to experiment with computer vision input.

Using the code and tools here, we cobble together a laser pointer tracker using OpenCV.

This is a simple way to track a red laser pointer. It is not fully robust (there are many ideas to explore), but 
works well enough under many lighting situations.

There is also code to help in reading the buttons of a presentation pointer. Typically these buttons control Page Up,
Page Down, Tab, Volume Increment and Volume Decrement. There are usually other values available. Most of these types
of devices have little implementation documentation, so it's necessary to play with them a little to see the output.
